## Course Overview

[Google translate](http://translate.google.com) instantly translates between any pair of over eighty human languages like French and English. How does it do that? Why does it make the errors that it does? And how can you build something better? Modern translation systems like Google Translate and [Bing Translator](https://www.bing.com/translator) learn to translate by reading millions of words of already translated text. This course will show you how they work. We cover fundamental building blocks from linguistics, machine learning (especially deep learning), algorithms, and data structures, showing how they apply to a difficult real-word artificial intelligence problem.

## Course Policies

#### Academic Integrity

This course follows the [University of Illinois Student Code regarding Academic Integrity](https://studentcode.illinois.edu/article1/part4/1-401). The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences also has [an excellent web page on the topic](http://www.las.illinois.edu/students/integrity). You are required to thoroughly read these resources no later than the Wednesday of the first week of class, and to thoroughly understand your responsibilities with regard to Academic Integrity. 

All work submitted for this class must be solely your own. Violations of Academic Integrity include, but are not limited to, copying, cheating, and unapproved collaboration. Violations will not be tolerated and can result in a failing grade. Ignorance is not an excuse.

Do not hesitate to ask the instructor(s) if you are ever in doubt about what constitutes plagiarism, cheating, or any other breach of academic integrity.

#### Communications

Course announcements, assignments, and due dates will all be communicated to students as announcements on the [the course forum on Campuswire](https://campuswire.com/c/G0D25C726/feed), which should be the **primary mechanism for communication** in this course. Students may post questions privately so that only the instructor can see the question. Other questions may be viewed by classmates, so that classmates can provide a peer response in addition to that provided by the instructor. Questions may also be asked anonymously, so that neither the instructor nor classmates will see the poster's name.

Office hours and one-on-one meetings with students will take place [over Zoom](https://illinois.zoom.us).
